## How to contribute

- Pull request should be made against the `development` branch until the milestone is reached and v2.0.0 is pushed into production.
- Breakdown commits and pull request to make review processes as fast as possible. For example do not create a single pull request for multiple issues/tasks.

##Building

- Import the project into Anrdoid Studio and build it just like any other android project.
- Replace the dummy keys with your own API keys in the `gradle.properties` file in order to make certain functions to work. You don't need to register an API key if you won't use these functions.
  - You need a backpack.tf API key (http://backpack.tf/api/register) for the price history function to work.
  - You need a steam web API key (http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) in order to be able to download steam user data.

## No Coding
- You can report issues or suggest new features in the [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bptfandroid) or [here on Github](https://github.com/Longi94/bptf/issues)
