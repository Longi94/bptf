## How to contribute

- Do not touch the `master` branch. This is the release branch and commits will be manually merged into it by me.
- Do not touch the `development` branch either for now. Pull request should be made against the `v2.0.0-beta` branch until the milestone is reached and v2.0.0 is pushed into production.
- Breakdown commits and pull request to make review processes as fast as possible. For example do not create a single pull request for multiple issues/tasks.
- Try to follow the coding style of Java and XML. Commenting also helps.

## Steps of contributing
1. Create an issue you are working on if it doesn't exist already.
2. Fork the repository if you haven't already.
3. Create a new branch from `v2.0.0-beta`.
4. Assign the issue to yourself by commenting on it with the link to the forked repo/branch.
5. Code stuff.
6. Test your code thoroughly including any other parts of the application that could be affected by your code.
7. Keep your repository updated. [Here's how.](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#keep-your-fork-synced)
8. Merge your branch into `v2.0.0-beta` and resolve conflicts if any.
9. Create a pull request and i will review it (if there are conflicts you cannot resolve by yourself, include them in the pull request and I will try to help).
