## How to contribute

- Do not touch the `master` branch. This is the release branch and commits will be manually merged into it by me.
- Do not touch the `development` branch either for now. Pull request should be made against the `v2.0.0-beta` branch until the milestone is reached and v2.0.0 is pushed into production.
- Breakdown commits and pull request to make review processes as fast as possible. For example do not create a single pull request for multiple issues/tasks.
- Try to follow the coding style of Java and XML. Commenting also helps.
